## AWS Javascript Developer Guide V2

The open source version of the AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide

This repository contains source content for the official AWS Java Developer Guide. The source code for the `AWS SDK for JavaScript 2.0`_ is also on GitHub, at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js.

The guide content relies upon content which is provided in the AWS documentation team's shared content and SDK examples repositories.

## Recent Updates

You can find out when this guide has been most recently updated and what changes were introduced in that update in the [Document History](/doc-history.md "Document History") topic.

## Reporting issues

You can use the Issues section of this repository to report problems in the documentation. When submitting an issue, please indicate:

  * what page (a URL or filename is best) the issue occurs on.
  * what the issue is, using as much detail as you can provide. For many issues, this might be as simple as "The page has a typo; the word 'complie' in the third paragraph shoud be 'compile'." If the issue is more complex, please describe it with enough detail that it's clear to the AWS documentation team what the problem is.

## Contributing fixes and updates

To contribute your own documentation fixes or updates, please use the Github-standard procedures for forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

Note that many common substitutions and extlinks found in these docs are sourced from the shared content repository--if you see a substitution used that is not declared at the top of the source file or in the _includes.txt file, then it is probably defined in the shared content.

The code examples featured in this documentation can be found in a separate repository: aws-doc-sdk-examples. Full code files are included, so you can run any of the provided examples yourself. Some examples were written for Node.js while others were written for browser script execution. The header comments in the code state the intended environment for that sample. 

In addition to examples in JavaScript, you'll also find examples for each of the other AWS SDKs. If you find issues with any of the examples, you can submit issues or fork the repository and submit a pull request!

The code examples are provided under the Apache 2.0 open source license. See the example repository's README for more details.
